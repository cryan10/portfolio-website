					Hello! &#128075; My name is Carrie and I am front-end web developer
					from Cleveland, Ohio. I've been a developer since 2017, and I love
					front-end development. I'm a firm believer in writing straightforward
					code. I get so much joy from writing a function that reads like a
					sentence. Simplicity, so beautiful.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm fascinated with accessibility and Atomic Design. I try to stay on
					top of the latest tech. For example, this website is built with Astro!
					It's incredible to see all the things that are happening with CSS, and
					how maybe we won't need SASS or LESS in the next 10 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy learning from others and mentoring less experienced teammates.
					I like to approach every pairing session with 2 corny, but true
					sayings in mind: "There's no such thing as a dumb question" and "When
					one of us shines, we all shine."
				</p>
				<p>
					I also really like learning about Scrum and Agile. I've been a
					Certified Scrum Master with Scrum Alliance since 2019. I like writing
					tickets and leading Scrum events like Retrospectives. I've been told I
					lead effective group discussions that encourage all teammates
					participate, and end with actionable items.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a creative spirit at heart. In my free time, I like to write and
					make music. I've played guitar for over 15 years, and I just recently
					started piano! I also love running, biking and aerial arts.
				</p>
